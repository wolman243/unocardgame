🛠 Technical Architecture
The project focuses on building a scalable architecture by leveraging Java’s core strengths and NetBeans' UI capabilities:

GUI Design with NetBeans: Utilized the NetBeans GUI Builder to design an intuitive interface, implementing Java Swing components to handle real-time game updates and player interactions.

Event-Driven Programming: Developed a sophisticated event-handling system to manage user inputs, card clicks, and automated turn transitions.

OOP-Based Game Logic: Each card and player is modeled as a distinct object, allowing for clean management of attributes (color, value, special actions) and efficient validation of game rules.

Stateful Game Engine: Implemented a central engine to track the game state, including the draw/discard piles, player turns, and the execution of "Wild," "Skip," and "Draw" mechanics.

🚀 Key Engineering Challenges
Dynamic UI Updates: Ensuring the interface accurately reflects the state of each player's hand and the discard pile after every move.

Logic Synchronization: Managing the complex flow of "Reverse" and "Skip" cards within a local multiplayer turn-loop.

Asset Management: Integrating visual assets (card images/icons) within the Java environment for an immersive user experience.

This project showcases my proficiency in Java development, Desktop GUI design, and the ability to transform complex logical requirements into a structured, object-oriented software solution.
